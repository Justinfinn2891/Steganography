A lot of our decision making took place from scratch on a white board. Before we set the code into
the terminal we brainstormed and planned out ways to attack the project, slowly taking on a method at a time.
You can run the program by choosing a setting between encoding and decoding:

encoding:
- you write in a ppm file and then the file containg your cipher text
- the program quickly writes in the imbedded message into the image and saves it to another ppm file.

decoding:
- takes your previously saved ppm file with the encoded message and decodes it
- returns a .txt file with the decoded message

The brainstorming was acted on both partners while the methods were mostly constructed by Gabriel Speer.
Justin Finn focused more on the header file and comments. Both partners contributed to the intense amount of debugging.
